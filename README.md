**Project Summary: Power Plant Energy Output Prediction**
As part of the [Duke AI Product Management course](https://www.coursera.org/specializations/ai-product-management-duke), I led a data-driven project to predict the net hourly energy output (PE) of a Combined Cycle Power Plant based on environmental conditions.

Using real-world sensor data (Ambient Temperature, Exhaust Vacuum, Ambient Pressure, Relative Humidity),

-  Explored feature correlations using heatmaps (AT was most influential, RH least).

-  Trained and compared 4 models: Linear Regression, SVR, Random Forest, and XGBoost.

-  Evaluated performance using MAE, RMSE, and R² score.

**XGBoost emerged as the best-performing model with lowest error and highest accuracy (R² ≈ 0.97).**

Highlighted the trade-off between model performance and interpretability, recommending Random Forest or XGBoost + SHAP for business contexts needing transparency.

This hands-on project helped me refresh my ML basics along with, emphasizing how to frame problems, evaluate model utility, and align solutions with stakeholder needs.

Along with this, Customer Churn Prediction for an OTT platform is documented with its privacy considerations as part of managing ML projects
